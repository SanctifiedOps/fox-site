Financial Freedom PFP generator (current spec)

1) Base assets
- Use `ff-chair.jpg` (full cabin + seat + table with logo/glass) as the fixed background. Keep its original dimensions (853x1280).

2) Model job
- Inputs:
  - Image 1: `ff-chair.jpg` (background, unchanged).
  - Image 2: user upload (character reference).
- API: OpenAI `gpt-image-1` via `images.edit`, size 1024x1536 (2:3), n:1.
- Prompt: keep the chair/tables/lighting identical; insert the main person from the second image seated naturally in the chair behind the table; strictly preserve likeness (face, hair, clothing, colours, and art style—if stylized/anime/illustrated, keep that stylization while matching the cabin lighting); do not add or remove accessories (hats, masks, glasses, props) unless they are present in the second image; keep the table/glass visible; no added text/props; no background changes.
- Output: full final composite from the model (no post-compositing required).

3) Endpoint contract (`/api/chair-pfp`)
- POST form-data field `photo`.
- Backend normalizes upload to PNG, calls `images.edit` with [base chair, user photo], returns JSON `{ image: <base64 png> }`.
- Frontend displays via `data:image/png;base64,...`.

4) Notes
- No manual compositing layers; the model returns the final image in one call.
- Resize returned image to 853x1280 if needed to match the base chair dimensions.
